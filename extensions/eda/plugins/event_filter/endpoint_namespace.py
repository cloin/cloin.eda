    Take the value of event['meta']['endpoint'] and create a new namespace for the event.
    Both the event payload and all the meta information will be moved under this new namespace if the endpoint is specified.

    For example:
    If the event is received on the "testing" endpoint, everything including 
    the event payload and all meta information should be accessible under event['testing'].

    If the endpoint isn't specified, it returns the original event.

    Parameters
    ----------
    event : dict
        The dictionary containing the event data.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        The modified event dictionary with the new namespace based on the endpoint, or the original event if no endpoint is specified.
